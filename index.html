(For example, <span class="math inline">(0,0)-(0,1)</span> has avg distance of 0.5 from origin, as does <span class="math inline">(0,0)-(1,0)</span>, so nothing is scaled if these are the only two edges. But if we add <span class="math inline">(0,9)-(0,11)</span>, which has an average distance from the origin of 10, that edge would be scaled up to <span class="math inline">(\text{distance}/\text{min distance}) = 10/0.5 = 20</span>.)</p>

What is the distribution of the distance between any two marbles after <span class="math inline">m</span> steps?</p>
<ul><li>8.1 <img src="media/1.png"> What is the distribution of the distance between every 2 marbles (e.g., for path <span class="math inline">a\to b\to c \to d</span>, the distance between <span class="math inline">a</span> and <span class="math inline">c</span>, and <span class="math inline">b</span> and <span class="math inline">d</span>)?</p>
